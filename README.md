Visit Waterford is an app to promote tourism in Waterford. When the app loads up the user will be asked to sign in or signup. If the user hasn’t signed up they need to register first before they can sign in. Once registered the user can then sign in, for the moment there is a temporary login as username: admin password:1234.

The app offers it’s user’s the ability to rate places they have visited as well as the option to add their own personal comments in the journal section. Within the journal the user can add their own comment and then be able to come back after leaving the page to view the comments left. The user will be able to edit their comment or delete it entirely. The option to donate to the app to promote tourism in Waterford is also an option.
